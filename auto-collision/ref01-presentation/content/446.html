As you can see we have a few tools laid out in front of us, such as a spanner wrench, which is provided by the manufacturer, along with some other tools laid out. The rebuild kit off to your left, this is purchased through the manufacturer. The kit comes with all the parts needed to rebuild the spray gun.
To begin the rebuild process let's now take the gun apart. The first step in taking the gun apart is removing the air cap, which is located at the front of the gun. This is going to screw off counterclockwise.
The next step is going to be removing the fluid control knob, which is located in the back of the gun, which is also loosened counterclockwise. Now inside this, there is a spring that will come out as well.
The next step will be to pull the trigger back and as you can see the fluid needle comes out as well.
Then the next step will be to remove the fluid nozzle, which is located in the front of the spray gun. Now this is done using this, the spanner wrench that we talked about earlier, using the center part of it, which fits right over the top. This is also taken off counterclockwise.
The next step is to remove the trigger assembly, which is right here, and as you can see there are two pins. And what hold those in are these two retaining clips. Now that we've removed the retaining clips, the trigger assembly is removed by pushing the pins through the backside as such and the trigger assembly will pull down. Now this washer up here, you will want to reinstall later on the top part of the pin.
Now that we have the trigger assembly removed, we can now remove the fluid needle bushing. With the bushing loosened, use the Allen wrench tool in order to remove the bushing, spring, and the needle packing.
Next we are going to use our Philips head screwdriver in order to remove the fan control knob. The spanner wrench is used to remove the fan control assembly.
The next step is to remove the air micrometer out of the back of the gun using an Allen wrench.
Next we are going to push the air piston needle back through the body of the gun and use our pick in order to push it out the backside.
Next step is to use our Allen wrench once again in order to remove the front retainer.
The air distribution ring is now removed using the special tool provided in the rebuild kit.
The spray gun is now fully disassembled.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></div>
