To help us with the installation process, we have Shawn Collins from 3M. Shawn, what is dirt trap and what's its purpose?
<STRONG>Shawn:</STRONG> Well Dan, dirt trap is a nonwoven, adhesively backed material. It's bright white in color, so it'll brighten up your booth, and also not interfere with any color matching. It's designed to trap airborne particles and dirt, for a cleaner paint job. 
<STRONG>Dan:</STRONG> What should be done to prepare a paint booth for the installation of the dirt trap?
<STRONG>Shawn:</STRONG> Well, a thorough cleaning of the booth is very important. Clean the booth by washing to remove dirt and dust. It's not necessary but you could paint the booth to enhance the brightness. Then you would want to vacuum the floor and install your filters and floor grates.
<STRONG>Dan:</STRONG> Shawn, if we have to rinse the booth or paint any of the walls, how long should we wait before installing the dirt trap? 
<STRONG>Shawn:</STRONG> Well, you just need to run a normal bake cycle or let the booth sit overnight to just really ensure that it is dry.
<STRONG>Dan:</STRONG> Since our paint booth is already prepped, why don't we head in and start the installation process.
<STRONG>Shawn:</STRONG> Sounds good.
<STRONG>Dan:</STRONG> Is there any special tools to help us install the dirt trap?
<STRONG>Shawn:</STRONG> Well, for best results and ease of application, we have two specially made applicators. One to apply it to the walls and another to apply it to the floor. When using the 3M Trip Trap wall applicator, it will apply the material quickly and evenly. 
Lower the carriage to start at the bottom of the booth first. Then start in one corner and roll the material around the entire perimeter of the booth.
When obstacles are encountered, you can either cut the material before the obstacle and restart on the other side, or you could cut a relief cut and roll over it, whichever is easiest for the installer. When the first level is complete, raise the carriage to the next level. The ideal overlap is one inch, which will be automatically done by the machine. Proceed with the second and top level. When completed, be sure to then squeegee down the entire booth to be certain that the adhesive has made complete contact.
<STRONG>Dan:</STRONG> Shawn, we have our walls all wrapped up, but what can we do with the booth floor? It seems to be one of the biggest problems for dirt and debris down there.
<STRONG>Shawn:</STRONG> Yeah, that's right. That is why we so happen to have this specially designed applicator to easily apply this to the floor. Let me show you how its done.
<STRONG>Dan:</STRONG> Sounds good.
<STRONG>Shawn:</STRONG> Starting on one side, start the material and pull back towards you until you have enough room to flip the handle of the applicator in the other direction. Then push along the length of the floor. When you reach the end of the booth, cut and move to the next section until the entire floor is covered.
<STRONG>Dan:</STRONG> Thanks for taking the time to show us how to install this dirt trap.
<STRONG>Shawn:</STRONG> Hey, absolutely, anytime. Enjoy your nice, clean booth.
<STRONG>Dan:</STRONG> Thanks.
<STRONG>Shawn:</STRONG> Alright.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></div>
