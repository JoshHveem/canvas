PDR is the removal of dents using specific tools and techniques. When doing PDR, there is no use of fillers or refinishing.</p><p>With us today is David from Dentsmart. David, can you tell us what makes a dent a good candidate for PDR?</p><p>(DAVID) Sure, the most important thing would be the size, obviously, with depth, width, and also location on the panel as far as access. In the case of hail damage, it would be the count or saturation of the panel. Those are the issues that I face as I go to repair a car.</p><p>(HOST) How do you repair a dent without damaging the finish?</p><p>(DAVID) One of the advantages that we have today is much more flexible metal. As we move this metal to change the memory back to pre-accident condition, certainly the flexibility helps. Second, because of the flexibility of the metal, these paints are more flexible today. It’s almost like a marriage between rubber and paint.</p><p>The most important tools that we use, obviously, are our eyes, and very graphic lighting which illuminates the dent so that we can see how well we’re repairing it, and when it’s done.</p><p>I’ve got a full tool set here. They are all specific to panels. We’ll just say this will be more the brace-type tools, these longer rods would be roofs and long quarter panels. Our fender tools are right here, usually pretty short panels so I have different kinds of tools for the fenders. For hard-to-access panels, we’ll utilize glue and glue tabs to remove the dents.</p><p>John, the most important tool I have in my bag is a light, so that we can illuminate the dent and see what’s going on. I’ve got a three-pronged light, so obviously you can see that dent in the light. I like the three lights, that way I can get more surface area to repair. Obviously you can see this dent as well. So that’s why I like the big graphic lights.&#160;</p><p>Now this first dent is in a brace, a pretty tight brace. I’m going to use a specific tool for braces. You enter from the bottom. Now I’ll do a couple of quick flexes, almost like a finger under a blanket to see where I’m at. Once I start to see where I’m at, my goal is to center this dent, put a pressure point or memory change right in the center of the dent. I want to make a more shallow version of itself. So as I bring this up, it’s starting to get a little more shallow. Now even though it doesn’t look like it’s changing, we are changing the memory, we are making memory changes just very slight. You have to be slow on the front end so that you can finish on the back end well. Accuracy is extremely important at this stage so that you can camouflage your repair. The natural texture of the paint is like an orange peel I want to camouflage the work into the orange peel texture.</p><p>As you can see, it’s really starting to shape up. I’ve gotten it into a shallower version of itself and I’m just taking out any imperfections that I see in it. And one little tiny low spot right here, and maybe one right there, and even though that looks repaired, to me, I still see the tiny little bits left over. And that should just about pass any experts opinion of a repair.</p><p>(HOST) PDR worked really well for that dent, now what would be a dent you wouldn’t consider for PDR repair?</p><p>(DAVID) Well, obviously the condition of the paint, you need that reflection. So if there’s paint missing or chipped out of the middle, for example, that could be a hindrance to our repair. It could be that it’s not a candidate for us to repair. The second thing, John, would be the size of the dent. The general rule of thumb would be a credit card length versus the width. Once it’s passed that length, most of the time that’s embedded or stretched metal especially in the case of hail damage and it would lessen its ability to repair in a paintless way.</p><p>John, also dents that are closer to the edge are tougher to repair than dents that are out here in the more flexible area of the panel. One other thing to consider is the saturation, or count, especially for hail damage. If this panel, especially a bolton panel, were to have hundreds and hundreds of dents, it may be less expensive to just replace the panel versus having a PDR technician work on it.</p><p>(HOST) The first repair we saw was on steel. Now a lot of newer vehicles are made out of higher strength steel or aluminum. What techniques do you use when approaching those materials?</p><p>(DAVID) John, it’s really the same technique. There is a lot more exertion to repair aluminum versus steel and high-strength steel. The good news is it’s better access, but it’s 25 – 50 percent more exertion just to get the dents out of this panel.</p></span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></div>
