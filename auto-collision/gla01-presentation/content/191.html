Collision or hail damage repair to these vehicles may require sunroof assembly removal and installation. Let’s see how this is done.</p>The sunroof glass is slid to the fully opened position, the ignition is turned OFF, and the key is removed. This vehicle has side curtain airbags which are disabled following the vehicle maker’s procedure by removing the airbag fuse from the fuse panel, and waiting the appropriate length of time before continuing work on the vehicle. The necessary interior trim is carefully removed to allow for the removal of the headliner. The headliner is then removed from the vehicle and carefully stored to prevent damage.</p>The wiring harness for the sunroof controls is disconnected. Note the close proximity of the side curtain airbag module wiring plug to the sunroof wiring harness. The sunroof drain hoses are disconnected from all four corners of the sunroof housing. Notice that the rear drain hoses run behind the side curtain airbag module. The bolts that hold the sunroof assembly to the roof structure are removed leaving one bolt on each side finger tight until a helper can assist with lowering it from the roof. The sunroof assembly is removed from the vehicle and carefully stored to prevent damage. Notice that this sunroof is removed as a one piece modular assembly and requires no disassembly of individual sunroof parts.</p>Once the necessary repairs to the vehicle have been completed, the sunroof assembly is carefully placed back in the vehicle with the aid of an assistant. It is lifted up and secured to the roof structure by installing one fastener on each side finger tight. The remaining fasteners are installed but not fully tightened. This vehicle has alignment holes in the sunroof assembly housing that are aligned to corresponding holes in the roof structure by inserting the appropriate size alignment pin. Once proper alignment is achieved and verified by the pins, the fasteners are tightened and the alignment is rechecked. The fasteners are then torqued to their proper specifications.</p>The drain hoses are then reconnected at all four corners of the housing assembly. Care is used to ensure that the hoses are securely attached to avoid water leaks at their connections. Again, notice the side airbag module and its close proximity to the sunroof assembly.</p>Before installing the headliner and interior trim, water is poured into the drain channel to check for plugged or leaking drain hoses. The drain hoses are routed through the roof pillars and carry the water outside the passenger compartment at the bases of the pillars.</p>No leaks are found, so the sunroof wiring is reconnected, and the headliner is reinstalled in the vehicle. The remaining interior trim is then reinstalled and the sunroof glass is slid to its fully closed position. A visual inspection of the glass panel alignment reveals a flushness problem between the sunroof glass and the roof skin.</p>The alignment of the glass panel on this vehicle is adjustable at the glass-to-sliding mechanism attachment. The fasteners are sufficiently loosened to allow for movement of the glass panel. The glass panel is aligned with the roof skin and the fasteners are tightened to prevent movement. Once proper alignment is verified, the fasteners are torqued to their proper specification.</p>The final step in the repair is to cycle the sunroof through its entire range of movement and verify smooth, trouble free operation. Notice that the “vent only” feature is also being checked for proper operation. The sunroof operates properly. The installation is now complete.</p></span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></div>
