This is causing binding and misalignment when the window is rolled up. Letâ€™s see how they are replaced.</p>First, the trim panel and moisture barrier are removed. The window regulator is attached to the door lock module assembly, which is bolted into the door shell. The counterbalance spring must be removed to release the tension on the regulator arms. A line is drawn through the center of the spring with a grease pencil to mark its position. A specialized tool is used to release and walk down the tension on the counterbalance spring, and the spring is removed. Watch the grease pencil marks on the spring as the tension is released.</p>The glass is lowered to access the fasteners that hold it to the regulator. Then the glass run is carefully pulled from the channels that hold it in place and the front channel is unbolted and removed from the door shell. The glass is fastened to the lower sash channel with plastic clips. These clips have retaining tabs on them that are depressed with a small flat blade screwdriver and the sash is then slid off of the glass. Notice that the clips remain attached to the glass. The glass is then removed from the door shell. The fasteners holding the lock module to the door shell are removed and the module is lifted from the door.</p>The lock module assembly is placed on a bench and the new regulator is inspected to verify that it is the correct part. The lower sash channel and spacer are slid off of the regulator arms. Notice the horizontal track on the lock module assembly that the guide on the small lifting arm slides into. The sash channel is then installed on the replacement regulator. Notice the spacer that is in the channel between the regulator arms. The regulator is positioned so that it will slide off of the holder for the counterbalance spring and is removed from the lock module assembly.</p>To install the new regulator, the small arm slides into the track in the lock module and the gear on the large arm is placed against the motor in the same position that the damaged regulator was in. The counterbalance spring holder is then pushed through the slot in the regulator and turned to lock it in position.</p>The lock module assembly is reinstalled into the door shell and the fasteners are tightened. Then the glass is positioned in the door, and the lower sash channel is slid over the clips until the retaining tabs snap into place against the sash bracket. The front window channel is bolted into the door shell, and the new glass run is installed. Care is taken to ensure that the glass run is fully seated into the channels.</p>Using the special tool, the counterbalance spring is installed in the holder and carefully walked up into tension. Notice that the grease pencil marks on the counterbalance spring are in line, indicating that the spring is set at the correct tension. The window is now rolled up and down to check for binding and to verify proper operation. The moisture barrier and trim panel are reinstalled to complete the repair.</p></span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></div>
