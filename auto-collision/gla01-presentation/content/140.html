Let’s see how some of them are done.</p>To determine if a vehicle has air leaks or wind noise, a test drive is performed with the aid of an assistant. If a leak is detected, more localized testing methods may be used to isolate its exact location. One simple method of locating the source of air leaks is to perform a thorough visual inspection of the sealing surface of the weatherstripping that the glass seals against. The weatherstripping is inspected for damage that may allow air leakage into the vehicle.</p>Another method of localized testing is the use of an ultrasonic leak detector. An ultrasonic transmitter is turned on and placed inside the vehicle close to the glass being tested for leaks. The receiver or “ear” of the system is turned on and its wand is slowly run around the perimeter of the sealing surface of the glass. Any areas of poor sealing will allow the signal from the transmitter to be picked up by the receiver, which produces an audible beep to inform that a leak has been detected.</p>Air leak sources may also be identified by a chalk or tracing powder test. A special tracing powder is applied to the surface of the glass that contacts the weatherstripping. The spray is allowed to dry undisturbed to a chalk-like or powdery surface. The glass is then closed and latched completely, without slamming. When the glass is reopened the contact surface of the weatherstripping is checked for the transfer of the powder to its surface. Gaps in the powder line on the weatherstripping indicate the areas with a poor seal.</p>The air pressure test can also be performed to locate leaks. Let’s see how this is done. The vehicle’s pressure relief valve is located and accessed in the trunk by pulling back the interior trim. Wide masking tape is used to completely cover the pressure relief valve. All the windows are then closed on the vehicle, and the ventilation fan is turned on with the selector on high speed in the defrost mode. With the doors unlocked and closed, and the ventilation fan running on high, a stethoscope is used to probe the sealing surfaces of the glass perimeter listening for the sound of escaping air.</p>Another method used in conjunction with the air pressure test is to spray the glass perimeter or sealing surface with soapy water and look for areas where escaping air makes or moves bubbles indicating a poor seal. Notice how the bubbles are pushed to the side each time that the glass is sprayed with the soapy water solution indicating an area of poor sealing and a potential wind noise or air leak source. The soap bubble test may also be done by blowing air at low pressure at specific spots inside the vehicle where a leak is suspected while spraying the outside with soapy water and looking for bubbles to form or be moved by escaping air.</p></span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></div>
